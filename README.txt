This app is developed and used in VSCode. You may also use cmd or powershell to start the application.

The pre-requisite installs include:
- Expo Go (used to view the app on a phone or a phone emulator)
- NodeJS (to be able to use npm commands in your terminal or cmd)

To access the app, you will open this program up in VSCode, or change your current working directory to the folder.

If the node-modules folder is missing in the files (it should not be for this prototype), you will need to type the following command in your terminal:

npm install


Once you have the node module files, you may start the app by typing:

npm start


This will start the app, and you will know when it starts as a local IPv4 address and a port number should show up as the address for this app. It will also show a QR code as well, which is a more convenient way of accessing the app if you are using a phone with a camera.

Open up the Expo Go app and either scan the QR code or type in the IP address. Wait paitiently for the app to start. You will know if you're successful if there is a loading bar in your terminal or if the app's main menu shows up on your screen.

Done! You have now successfully accessed the Good Day App!
